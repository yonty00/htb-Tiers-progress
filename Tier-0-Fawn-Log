## Overview
- **Category:** Parrot Linux, ftp protocol, Exploitation
- **Tier:** 0

## Tools Used
- Ping IP
- Nmap (sudo privilege)
- FTP commands > ftp [target ip] > ftp help
-Linux command > get filename.txt > cat filename.txt

## What I Did / Approach
1. **Enumeration:**  
   - Ping Target IP to detect connection and make sure it is established.
   - Used nmap for port scanning, but with sudo privileges, also add the -sV flag for version detection.  
	Sudo nmap -sV [target ip]

     - Dectected that ftp protocol runs in one of the open ports, I proceeded to exploit. More info about FTP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) 

2. **Exploitation:**  
   - Discovered that FTP protocol runs on port #
   - A misconfiguration on the ftp server can let an “anonymous” user access the service 
   - Used the proper username plus credentials for anonymous to get access.
   - Access to service was granted using anonymous credentials.
3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - When inside the ftp server. I use the ls command to discover files within the server. 
   - I was able to find the flag.txt file, then I proceed to download the file to my machine using the “get” command.
   - When file was downloaded, quite the ftp connection then using the “cat” command I was able to read the flag.txt file

## What I Learned
   - FTP can be used to transfer log files from one network device to another or a log collection server.
   - FTP servers can give access to anyone if they are misconfigured.
   - Files can be intercepted with what is known as Man-in-the-Middle Attack MitM)
   - SFTP is more secure as it runs SSH and secured against any interception.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initially ran nmap for port scanning, then after knowing the open port for ftp, I proceeded to access the target machine with “anonymous” credential.
- **Solution:** Anonymous credentials gave access to ftp servers, I was able to download the flag to my machine and cat the file.
