## Overview
- **Category:** Parrot Linux, SMB, Exploitation
- **Tier:** 0

## Tools Used
- Ping IP
- Nmap (sudo privilege) w/ flag -sV = Version
- Smbclient

## What I Did / Approach
1. **Enumeration:**  
   - Ping Target IP to detect connection and make sure it is established.
   - Used nmap for port scanning, but with sudo privileges, also add the -sV flag for version detection.  
	Sudo nmap -sV [target ip]

     - Detected port 445 running TCP Microsoft-ds

2. **Exploitation:**  
   - Discovered that smb protocol runs on port 445
   - Attempted to login using “Guest” or “Anonymous” 
   - Ran smb command with target’s IP  - smbclient -L {target IP}
   - Access a table with share name users, type and commands. 
3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   -one of the shareuser don’t require password as is misconfigured. 
   -  When logged in, “help” will show you all command that can be used within smb.
   - The misconfigured user has two directories with txt files.
   - Downloaded all txt files (including flag.txt) with “get” command to my local machine. 
   - Quit smbclient and I checked the files in the download folder.
   - Used the “cat” command to see what was inside each file. Found the flag!

## What I Learned
   - SMB is a protocol that allows you to share files, printers, and serial ports between endpoints on a network. 
   - If a share user is misconfigured, the attacker can have access to the users’ account without a password and dig around for files or info.
   - Nmap tool is very useful to discover open ports in target’s machine. 

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initially ran nmap for port scanning, then after knowing the open port for SMB, I proceeded to access the target machine with smbclient command and display the share users.
- **Solution:** One of the share users is misconfigured and does not require credentials.
After entering the user’s account, I was able to look around and download all the txt files to my local machine, then user “cat” command to see the flag.txt file.
