## Overview
- **Category:** Parrot Linux, Telnet Enumeration, Exploitation 
- **Tier:** 0

## Tools Used
- Ping IP
- Nmap / service detection flag [-sV] - nmap -sV [target IP]
- Telnet

## What I Did / Approach
1. **Enumeration:**  
   - Ping the Target to determine connection, packets reach destination and check if the connection is formed and stable. 
   - Used nmap with detection flag -sV to scan ports and to determine the name and description of the identified services.  
	- For more info on -sV Service and Version Detection (https://nmap.org/book/man-version-detection.html) 
   - After analyzing open ports and discovering Telnet service, I proceeded to connect via Telnet to target machine.
   - Telnet is an old service remote management for other hosts on the network. 
2. **Exploitation:**  
   - Telnet misconfiguration. Used default credentials for access. 
3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - System access and navigate through the system to show the flag.

## What I Learned
- Telnet is an old service remote management that should be configured properly if used.
- Users must set up a strong username and password when using Telnet as default users’ names and passwords can be found on the web.
- Accessing through telnet can be dangerous as you can navigate throughout the folder directory and exploit it even more. 

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Find the flag by using telnet in target machine.
- **Solution:** Used default username and password for access, then navigate through directory to find flag.
